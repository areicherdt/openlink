# openLink
A Viessmann optolink service that regularly reads out all specified values and provides the data via a REST interface.

The viessmann 300 and kw protocols are currently implemented. Only the kw was extensively tested.
Further systems such as openHAB (http binding) can be connected via the REST interface.
